## Bio

I study Molecular Biology, Public Health (Bisotatistics Concentration), and Women, Gender, and Sexuality Studies at Johns Hopkins. I am interested in leveraging quantitative tools (STATA, R, Python) to answer questions pertaining to reproductive and sexual health as well as oral (community health). I would like to learn more about data visualization techniques and improve on my data analys skills. 

## Five Fun Facts
1. I write poetry in my free time and run the undergraduate club Bluejays and Poets. 
2. I took ballet classes growing up and was involved in the JHU Ballet Company. 
3. I am interested in digital and film photography!
4. I am ambidextrous. 
5. I met the Prime Minister of Romania!

## Inspiring Link
One of my favorite poems is [Wild Geese by Mary Oliver](http://www.phys.unm.edu/~tw/fas/yits/archive/oliver_wildgeese.html). I am not sure why I like it, but I do quite a lot!
